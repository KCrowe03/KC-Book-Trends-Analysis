Iâ€™m refreshing an older project I started a few months ago. I originally set it up to explore book ratings and trends, but now I want to take it further and improve how everything is organized.

The data for this project comes from two datasets I downloaded from Kaggle. One includes a collection of Goodreads books and their details, and the other contains user ratings from a sample of books with 0 to 1000 reviews.

## What I want to learn from the data:
Which books get the highest average ratings?
Do books with more reviews tend to have lower or higher scores?
Do books by the same author tend to be rated similarly?
Are there patterns in genre or page count that affect ratings?

## Tools I'm using:
Python
pandas
Jupyter Notebook
