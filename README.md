# KC Book Trends Analysis

This is a refreshed version of a project I started a few months ago. I'm revisiting it now to improve the structure, clean up the code, and apply what I’ve learned about data analysis. This project focuses on exploring trends in book ratings using real-world data.

## Datasets Used

Goodreads book information
Book ratings 0–100 scale

The data files were downloaded from Kaggle and are stored locally in the data/ folder. They are excluded from version control using .gitignore.

## Project Goals
Practice exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Remove columns that are unnecessary
Check for missing data
Look at rating trends by book and author
Improve code organization and readability as I learn

## Key Data Questions
Which authors appear most frequently in the Goodreads dataset?  
What is the distribution of user-submitted ratings on the 0–100 scale?  
Do highly rated books tend to come from specific publishers or genres?

## Next Steps
Visualize top-rated books and most frequently rated authors
Consider merging the two datasets using book titles
Continue cleaning and commenting the notebook for clarity

## Tools Used
Python  
pandas  
Jupyter Notebook  
GitHub  
Kaggle (for dataset sourcing)
Visual Studio Code
